//step 1:
1.npm create vite@4.1.0
2.npm i 
3.cd expense-tracker
4.npm i 
5.npm i bootstrap@5.2.3
6.import bootstrap into the main.tsx 
imports in the main.tsx: 
import "./index.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
-> the styles from bootstrap comes from under the Forms section not the 
component we have Form Control and Select
//we have defined the jsx of form (from forms under form controls)
//I have made the labels(form-label) and the inputs (form-control)
and for the select element I made an array and I mapped it in the jsx to
option tag elements to make it more dynamic (if we want to add any options
we dont have to hard code it we can just add it in the array and it will automatically add 
and option element for it in the select tag
using conditional rendering if the option is Choose an option make it selected at first and then disabled)

step 2: I will use the react hook form to be able to access the values from the input fields and the select


//step 3: I will add the validation rules using zod
validation rules added with zod but handled the Category as min should be at least 1 character 
and the default value is '' empty string (so when it is '' empty string 0 characters it 
will give an error)

//the table format came from content under it Tables
